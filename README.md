# opencv_contrib_3.3with_TrackerMOSSE
TrackerMOSSE is suported by opencv-3.4+, but for some reason I have to use opencv-3.3, so I modify the tracking module of opencv_contrib-3.3 to support TrackerMOSSE, mostly by moving the include headers and mosseTracker.cpp from opencv_contrib-3.4 to opencv_contrib-3.3. 
In conclusion, this repository is opencv_contrib-3.3 with TrackerMOSSE, which can be compiled with opencv_3.3.
